  <!-- This is creating a Bean, it goes to the package and the HelloSpringBean
  class. The id is the reference to my bean that is class="package.class"
  format. We create this file because, we would make one modification here to
  make the whole application work if I was to rename classes etc.

  This is the old way of doing things, new way is to use JavaConfig-->
  <bean id="bean" class="com.di.helloworld.HelloSpringBean"></bean>
